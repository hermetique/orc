This directory contains the CLOC language definition for Orc in the file: orc.langdef.

Use as follows:

cloc --force-lang-def=orc.langdef ...

This makes CLOC only operate on Orc files. If you need to count more than one language
you will need to build your own integrated lang-def file since Orc conflicts with PHP
and Pascal on the .inc suffix.
