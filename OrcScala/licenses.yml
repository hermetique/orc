# Each dependency includes the following information:
#
# files: list of incorporated files
# project: the project from which the files were derived
# version: the version of the project
# url: the url for the project
# license: license covering incorporated files; see license/ directory
# phase: build = used for compilation only, not at runtime.
#        link = linked against but not extended.
#        extend = classes are extended.
#        modify = we bundle modified versions of the code.
# notes: any notes about why the dependency is needed
