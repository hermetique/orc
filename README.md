# README for orc repository


Welcome! This repository includes documentation, implementation, tools,
libraries, tests, and examples for the Orc programming language.

Orc can be used in several different ways:
- In-Web-browser interface
- Eclipse IDE plug-in
- Command line JVM invocation
- macOS application
- Embedded in other applications
- SOAP/JSON/RMI

An in-browser version of Orc (called "Try Orc"), as well as downloadable
versions and installation instructions are available at the Orc Web
site: https://orc.csres.utexas.edu/ .  The Web site also provides the
language tutorial and reference guides, discussion groups, a wiki, and
more.

There are numerous examples of Orc programs included in Try Orc, the
tutorial and reference guides, and the OrcExamples subproject here.

We encourage you to contact us via the discussion groups or e-mail if
you have questions.  See the https://orc.csres.utexas.edu/ Web site for
contact details.
