                        README for OrcO Preview

This is a preview of OrcO. It is not reliable or stable yet, but it 
does enable the examples from the paper and other examples to run. This
release does not include distributed or compilation features and is 
very slow and contains many issues like any prototype software. The
examples from the paper are in example/orco_paper in the preview archive 
(and ../OrcExamples/orco_paper in the repository).

Orc runs in a Java SE 6 runtime environment. Required JARs are included
here, in the "lib" directory.

Orc can be used as a command line Java application (see USING ORC below).

There are numerous examples of Orc programs included in the "examples"
directory. 

See https://orc.csres.utexas.edu/ for more information about Orc,
including the language user's guide, discussion groups, a wiki, and more.

See the files LICENSE and licenses.yml for license agreements. See 
licenses.yml for information on bundled third-party libraries and code.

USING ORC

To run Orc programs invoke the class orc.Main with all the included JARs 
on the class path.

java -cp orc-2.1.0.jar:orc-sites-2.1.0.jar:lib/\* orc.Main examples/orco_paper/sec5-1_event_handling.orc
