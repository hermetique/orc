This project contains system testing tools, cases, and data for the OrcScala and OrcSites projects.

This project does //not// contain unit tests.
Those belong in the projects with the code being tested.

(This project may use testing frameworks with "unit" in their name, but they are not be used for unit testing here.)

----

For clarity, here are terms used in this project:

**testing.** The process of operating a system or component under specified conditions, observing or recording the results, and making an evaluation of some aspect of the system or component.

* Test levels:
## **unit testing.** Testing of individual hardware or software units or groups of related units.
## **integration testing.** Testing in which software components, hardware components, or both are combined and tested to evaluate the interaction between them.
## **system testing.** Testing conducted on a complete, integrated system to evaluate the system's compliance with its specified requirements.

* Objectives of testing -- Common examples:
** **functional testing.** Testing conducted to evaluate the compliance of a system or component with specified functional requirements.
** **performance testing.** Testing conducted to evaluate the compliance of a system or component with specified performance requirements.
** **qualification testing.** Testing conducted to determine whether a system or component is suitable for operational use.
** **stress testing.** Testing conducted to evaluate a system or component at or beyond the limits of its specified requirements.

* Function vs. performance:
** **function.** A defined objective or characteristic action of a system or component.
** **performance.** The degree to which a system or component accomplishes its designated functions within given constraints, such as speed, accuracy, or memory usage.

//Note:// **benchmark.** [often misused] A standard or point of reference against which things may be compared or assessed.

* Valid vs. invalid:
** Functional //valid// test cases are expected to accomplish a user-level action.
** Functional //invalid// test cases are expected to provide a diagnostic indication, and not accomplish any user-level action; that is, invalid test cases are erroneous input to Orc.
