                 INSTALL for PorcE Truffle Interpreter


Overview
--------

This project contain a Truffle-based interpreter for Orc. Truffle and 
associated technologies are also called, variously, GraalVM, Polyglot, and 
PolyglotVM. This is not to be confused with the Graal backend compiler which
is used by Truffle and may eventually replace the C2 JVM compiler. Also, the
SubstrateVM (also occasionally called the GraalVM) is a separate non-JVM way
to use Graal (the backend compiler) and not directly related to Truffle.

You will note that this ecosystem is very confusing and a total mess. For 
the moment, here are instructions on how to install a GraalVM that can run 
PorcE and how to connect it to this project. In addition, there are 
instructions for setting up a launch configuration for PorcE.

Setup instructions
------------------

1. Download GraalVM EE (Enterprise Edition) 1.0.0-rc9 from 
   https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/oracle-labs/program-languages/downloads/index.html 
   (requires login) and unpack it to $UNPACK (any directory). You will need to replace 
   "$UNPACK" with the absolute path you unpacked to in all the further instructions.
2. Add a new JRE in Eclipse (Eclipse Preferences -> Java / Installed JREs -> Add),
   type "Standard VM".
3. Set:
    * JRE home: $UNPACK/graalvm-ee-1.0.0-rc9
    * JRE name: graalvm-ee-1.0.0-rc9
    * Default VM arguments: -XX:-UseJVMCIClassLoader
4. Add/Update a Classpath Variable (Eclipse Preferences -> Java -> Build Path -> Classpath 
   Variables) named GRAALVM_JRE and set it to "$UNPACK/graalvm-ee-1.0.0-rc9". This allows
   PorcE to find the annotation processor and libraries used by the Truffle code.
5. Rebuild the PorcE project.

Launch instructions
-------------------

1. Create a new run configuration (Run -> Run Configurations) of type Java
   Application.
2. Set:
    * Name: PorcE [or your choice]
    * Project: PorcE
    * Main class: orc.Main
2. In the JRE tab, ensure that the run configuration JRE is set to your new GraalVM JRE.
3. Add the command line arguments "--backend porc -O 3" (the "-O 3" is optional, 
   but recommended, since PorcE is not heavily tested without it, "-O 1" is faster
   and moderately well tested). 
3. Add command line arguments as needed to launch the desired Orc program.

Running PorcE from the Orc Eclipse plug-in is unsupported for now.


NOTE: All of this will change eventually when GraalVM supports JDK11 and amp gets 
this all working on JDK11.
